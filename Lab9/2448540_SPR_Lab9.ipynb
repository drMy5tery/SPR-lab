    "## 6. Viterbi Algorithm Implementation\nThe Viterbi algorithm is a dynamic programming method used to find the most likely sequence of hidden states (the Viterbi path). It works in three main phases:\n1.  **Initialization**: We calculate the probability of the first state based on the Initial Probabilities ($\\pi$) and the Emission Probabilities ($B$) for the first observation.\n2.  **Recursion**: For each subsequent time step $t$, we calculate the probability of being in each state $j$. We do this by considering all possible previous states $i$, multiplying the probability of being in $i$ at $t-1$ by the transition probability from $i$ to $j$ and the emission probability of the current observation. We take the maximum of these values. Crucially, we store a \"backpointer\" to the previous state that yielded this maximum probability.\n3.  **Termination & Backtracking**: After processing all observations, we identify the final state with the highest probability. We then follow the backpointers in reverse order to reconstruct the optimal path of states from the end back to the beginning.\n"
